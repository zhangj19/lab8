(*======================================================================
Functors - Part 2.

In this second part of the lab, you'll rewrite the Stack module from
the previous lab so that its element type is polymorphic, while adding
some functionality at the same time.

Occasionally, it's useful to be able to take a data structure and
"serialize" it (also called "marshalling"), that is, to transform its
internal computational representation into a format, like a string,
that can be saved in a file or transmitted digitally. It can later be
"deserialized" to recreate the internal representation. You may notice
that this provides an opportunity to break an abstraction barrier:
serializing an object, manipulating its string representation, and
then deserializing back to an object could allow for some invariant to
be violated. Even so, serialization has its uses when the
circumstances are warranted. As a result, we'll add to the stack
module extremely basic support for serialization.

In order to do this with an abstract type for an element in a stack,
we will need to have access to a function `serialize` that can accept
a stack element and return a string.

We can use a functor to generate a stack that bundles everything
together.

In order to do this, we'll first define a module interface, called
SERIALIZE, that captures the requirements for the elements of a
stack. It requires that the module expose both a data type and a
function that converts values of that type into a string
representation. As you'll see, the SERIALIZE module type is an
appropriate signature for the argument of a functor that generates
serializable stack modules. *)

module type SERIALIZE =
  sig
    type t
    val serialize : t -> string
  end ;;

(* Now we'll define a STACK interface. Notice that unlike the
`INT_STACK` interface from the previous lab, we'll specify the
`element` type to be an abstract type as part of the signature, and
add additional functions for serialization, as well as a couple of
higher-order functions over stacks. *)

module type STACK =
  sig
    exception Empty
    type element
    type stack
    val empty : stack
    val push : element -> stack -> stack
    val top : stack -> element
    val pop : stack -> stack
    val serialize : stack -> string
    val map : (element -> element) -> stack -> stack
    val filter : (element -> bool) -> stack -> stack
    val fold_left : ('a -> element -> 'a) -> 'a -> stack -> 'a
  end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 1A: Rewrite your stack implementation from the last lab to
use the `element` abstract data type for elements, and also complete
the other functions that the signature requires. We've provided a good
start below.

The serialize function should construct a string in the following
form:

    "N0:N1:N2:...:N"

where N0 was the *first* element pushed onto the stack, N1 was the
*second*, and so on, with N being the *most recent* element pushed to
the stack, that is, the one to be popped next. (This would make
deserialization easier, since elements could be pushed as soon as they
were read.)

(Don't forget that you can implement other functions that are not
specified by the signature if you would like. The module signature
will act as an absrtaction barrier to prevent the extra functions from
leaking out of the module.)
......................................................................*)

module MakeStack (Element: SERIALIZE) : (STACK with type element = Element.t) =
  struct
    exception Empty

    type element = Element.t
    type stack = element list

    let empty : stack = []

    let push (el : element) (s : stack) : stack =
      failwith "push not implemented"

    let pop_helper (s : stack) : (element * stack) =
      failwith "pop_helper not implemented"

    let top (s : stack) : element =
      failwith "top not implemented"

    let pop (s : stack) : stack =
      failwith "pop not implemented"

    let map (f : element -> element) (s : stack) : stack =
      failwith "map not implemented"

    let filter (f : element -> bool) (s : stack) : stack =
      failwith "filter not implemented"

    let fold_left (f : 'a -> element -> 'a) (init : 'a) (s : stack) : 'a =
      failwith "fold_left not implemented"

    let serialize (s : stack) : string =
      failwith "serialize not implemented"
  end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 1B: Now, make a module `IntStack` by applying the functor
that you just defined to an appropriate module for serializing integers.
......................................................................*)

module IntStack = struct end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 1C: Make a module `IntStringStack` that creates a stack whose
elements are `int * string` pairs. Its serialize function should output
values as strings of the form:

    "(N,'S')"

where N is the int, and S is the string. For instance, a stack with
two elements might be serialized as the string

    "(1, 'pushed first'):(2, 'pushed second')"     .

For this oversimplified serialization function, you may assume that
the string will be made up of alphanumeric characters only.
