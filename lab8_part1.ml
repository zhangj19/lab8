This lab practices concepts of functors.

Real World OCaml <http://dev.realworldocaml.org/functors.html>. *)

(*======================================================================
Functors - Part 1.

For the first part of this lab, you will explore a realistic and
useful application of functors -- a library to support interval
computation. 

Intervals come up in many different contexts. As a concrete example,
calendars need to associate events with time intervals (3-4pm or
11:30am-3:30pm). Intervals can be empty (like the interval starting at
4pm and ending at 3pm; it contains no time at all). We might want to
know if a value is contained within an interval. (For example, 4pm is
not contained within 11:30am-3:30pm, but is contained within 2-5pm.)
We may want to know the intersection of two intervals. (The
intersection of 3-4pm and 11:30am-3:30pm is 3-3:30pm.)

Importantly, intervals can be defined over different data types. For
instance you may want to use intervals of floating point values or, as
in the example above, intervals of times. But regardless of the type
the intervals are over, you'll want some common basic operations:
constructing an interval, checking if an interval is empty, checking
if a point is contained within an interval, and intersecting two
intervals. (Of course, in an actual interval library, you'd want
several other operations as well, but this will get us started.)

Let’s examine how we can build a *generic* interval library using
functors.

For a given interval, we will need some information about the
endpoints of the interval. In our interface we will need both the type
of the endpoints and a method of comparing endpoints.

The ORDERED_TYPE signature from the textbook (Section 12.3) will serve
us nicely here. It uses the OCaml convention for comparison functions
used by the Stdlib.compare function:

    compare x y < 0     (* x < y *)
    compare x y = 0     (* x = y *)
    compare x y > 0     (* x > y *)
 *)

module type ORDERED_TYPE = 
  sig
    type t
    val compare : t -> t -> int
  end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 1A: Complete the following functor for making interval modules.

We represent an interval with a variant type, which is either `Empty`
or `Interval (x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are the bounds of the
interval, and are themselves contained within the interval. The
representation has an invariant that `x` is always less than or equal
to `y` (where the notion of "less than or equal" is given by the
`compare` function provided by the `ORDERED_TYPE` that the intervals
are built from).

The functor definition starts out as

    module MakeInterval (Endpoint : ORDERED_TYPE) = 
      struct
        ...
      end

Here, the argument to the functor is a module, given the name
`Endpoint` and constrained to satisfy the ORDERED_TYPE module
signature. Thus, we know that `Endpoint` will provide both a type
(`Endpoint.t`) and a comnparison function over that type
(`Endpoint.compare`). We can and will use those in defining the module
being defined by the functor.

Now, complete the funcctor definition below.
......................................................................*)

module MakeInterval (Endpoint : ORDERED_TYPE) = 
  struct
    type interval =
      | Interval of Endpoint.t * Endpoint.t
      | Empty

    (* create low high -- Returns a new interval covering `low` to
       `high` inclusive. If `low` is greater than `high`, then the
       interval is empty. *)
    let create (low : Endpoint.t) (high : Endpoint.t) : interval =
      if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
      else Interval (low, high)

    (* is_empty intvl -- Returns true if and only if `intvl` is
       empty *)
    let is_empty (intvl : interval) : bool =
      match intvl with
      | Empty -> true
      | Interval _ -> false

    (* contains intvl x -- Returns true if and only if the value `x`
       is contained within `intvl` *)
    let contains (intvl : interval) (x : Endpoint.t) : bool =
      match intvl with
      | Empty -> false
      | Interval (low, high) ->
         Endpoint.compare x low >= 0
         && Endpoint.compare x high <= 0

    (* intersect intvl1 intvl2 -- Returns the intersection of `intvl1`
       and `intvl2` *)
    let intersect (intvl1 : interval) (intvl2 : interval) : interval =
      let ordered x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x, y else y, x in
      match intvl1, intvl2 with
      | Empty, _
      | _, Empty -> Empty
      | Interval (low1, high1), Interval (low2, high2) ->
         let (_, low), (high, _)  = ordered low1 low2, ordered high1 high2 in
         create low high
    end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 1B: Using the completed functor above, instantiate an integer
interval module.
......................................................................*)

module IntInterval =
  MakeInterval (struct 
                  type t = int 
                  let compare = Stdlib.compare
                end) ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 1C: Using your newly created integer interval module, create
two non-empty intervals named `intvl1` and `intvl2` that have some
overlap, and calculate their intersection as `intvl1_intersect_intvl2`.
......................................................................*)

let intvl1 = IntInterval.create 3 8 ;;
let intvl2 = IntInterval.create 4 10 ;;
let intvl1_intersect_intvl2 = IntInterval.intersect intvl1 intvl2 ;;

(* There's currently a problem with the `MakeInterval` functor. It's
not abstract enough. Notably we are working with an invariant that a
valid non-empty interval has an upper bound that is greater than or
equal to its lower bound. However, this is only enforced by the
`create` function, and as it turns out, we can actually bypass the
`create` function due to our lack of an abstraction barrier.

This expression returns `true`, as expected.

    IntInterval.is_empty (IntInterval.create 4 3) ;;

This, however, returns `false`. Yikes.

    IntInterval.is_empty (IntInterval.Interval (4, 3)) ;;

**Make sure you understand why this is a problem. If you don't see the
issue, call over a staff member to discuss.**

To make our functor more abstract, we need to restrict the output of
`MakeInterval` to an interface that prevents users from directly
creating interval implementations themselves without using the
`create` function.

........................................................................
Exercise 2A: Complete the following interface for an interval
module. Note in particular that we should add a new type `endpoint` to
give us a way of abstractly referring to the type for the endpoints of
an interval.
......................................................................*)

module type INTERVAL = 
  sig
    type interval
    type endpoint
    val create : endpoint -> endpoint -> interval
    val is_empty : interval -> bool
    val contains : interval -> endpoint -> bool
    val intersect : interval -> interval -> interval
  end ;;

(*......................................................................
Exercise 2B: Define the MakeSafeInterval functor using MakeInterval as
a starting point, such that it returns a module restricted to the
INTERVAL signature. (Much of the implementation can be copied from
MakeInterval above.) **Don't forget to specify the module type.**
......................................................................*)

(* Note the specification of the module type here ------+         
                                                        v            *)                                                      
module MakeSafeInterval (Endpoint : ORDERED_TYPE) : INTERVAL =

  (* The rest of the implementation is just as before. *)
  struct
    type endpoint = Endpoint.t
    type interval =
      | Interval of endpoint * endpoint
      | Empty

    (* create low high -- Returns a new interval covering `low` to
       `high` inclusive. If `low` > `high`, then the interval is
       empty. *)
    let create (low : endpoint) (high : endpoint) : interval =
      if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
      else Interval (low, high)

    (* is_empty intvl -- Returns true if and only if the `intvl` is
       empty *)
    let is_empty (intvl : interval) : bool =
      match intvl with
      | Empty -> true
      | Interval _ -> false

    (* contains intvl x -- Returns true if and only if the value `x`
       is contained within `intvl` *)
    let contains (intvl : interval) (x : Endpoint.t) : bool =
      match intvl with
      | Empty -> false
      | Interval (low, high) ->
         Endpoint.compare x low >= 0
         && Endpoint.compare x high <= 0

    (* intersect intvl1 intvl2 -- Returns the intersection of the two
       input intervals *)
    let intersect (intvl1 : interval) (intvl2 : interval) : interval =
      let ordered x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x, y else y, x in
      match intvl1, intvl2 with
      | Empty, _
      | _, Empty -> Empty
      | Interval (low1, high1), Interval (low2, high2) ->
         let (_, low), (high, _)  = ordered low1 low2, ordered high1 high2 in
         create low high
  end
;;

(* We have successfully made our returned module abstract, but believe
it or not, it is now too abstract. In fact, we have not exposed the
type of endpoints to the user, meaning we cannot even create intervals
now. To demonstrate the problem ...

........................................................................
Exercise 2C: Create an IntSafeInterval module using the new
MakeSafeInterval functor.
......................................................................*)

module IntSafeInterval =
  MakeSafeInterval
    (struct 
      type t = int 
      let compare = Stdlib.compare
    end) ;;

(* Now, try evaluating the following expression in the REPL:

    IntSafeInterval.create 2 3 ;; 

A type error will appear: 

    Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type
           IntInterval.endpoint

To make the interface slightly less abstract, we can make use of a
sharing constraint, which informs the compiler that a given type
within the implementation is equal to some other type from outside the
implementation. In this case, we want to inform the compiler the type
of our endpoint is an int, and more generally that the type of our
endpoint is Endpoint.t, where Endpoint was the ORDERED_TYPE module
inputted to the functor. We can do so with the following syntax:

<Module_type> with type <type> = <type'>

For instance, we can create int interval and float interval interfaces
that reveal the type of endpoints as follows: *)

module type INT_INTERVAL =
  INTERVAL with type endpoint = int ;;

module type FLOAT_INTERVAL =
  INTERVAL with type endpoint = float ;;

(* Modules that satisfy these interfaces will allow users to actually
construct intervals of the desired types.

While sharing constraints solve the abstraction issue discussed
earlier, they now present a new problem. They will result in code
duplication in implementation. The solution to this is to use sharing
constraints in the MakeInterval functor, exposing that the type of an
endpoint is equal to Endpoint.t. The functor can then be used to
create interval modules of various types without duplicating code. *)

(*......................................................................
Exercise 3A: Define a new functor MakeBestInterval. It should take an
ORDERED_TYPE module for the endpoints of the intervals, and return a
module satisfying INTERVAL *with appropriate sharing constraints
to allow the creation of generic interval modules*.
......................................................................*)

module MakeBestInterval (Endpoint : ORDERED_TYPE)
                      : (INTERVAL with type endpoint = Endpoint.t) = 
  struct
    type endpoint = Endpoint.t
    type interval = | Interval of endpoint * endpoint
                    | Empty

    (* create low high -- Returns a new interval covering `low` to
       `high` inclusive. If `low` > `high`, then the interval is
       empty. *)
    let create (low : endpoint) (high : endpoint) : interval =
      if Endpoint.compare low high > 0 then Empty
      else Interval (low, high)

    (* is_empty intvl -- Returns true if and only if the `intvl` is
       empty *)
    let is_empty (intvl : interval) : bool =
      match intvl with
      | Empty -> true
      | Interval _ -> false

    (* contains intvl x -- Returns true if and only if the value `x`
       is contained within `intvl` *)
    let contains (intvl : interval) (x : Endpoint.t) : bool =
      match intvl with
      | Empty -> false
      | Interval (low, high) ->
         Endpoint.compare x low >= 0
         && Endpoint.compare x high <= 0

    (* intersect intvl1 intvl2 -- Returns the intersection of the two
       input intervals *)
    let intersect (intvl1 : interval) (intvl2 : interval) : interval =
      let ordered x y = if Endpoint.compare x y <= 0 then x, y else y, x in
      match intvl1, intvl2 with
      | Empty, _
      | _, Empty -> Empty
      | Interval (low1, high1), Interval (low2, high2) ->
         let (_, low), (high, _)  = ordered low1 low2, ordered high1 high2 in
         create low high

(* We now have a fully functioning functor that can create interval
modules of whatever type we want, with the appropriate abstraction
level.

Exercise 3B: Use the MakeBestInterval functor to create a new int
interval module, and test that it works as expected.

You may for instance want to try the problematic lines from Exercise 1C.

This expression should still return true, as expected:

    IntBestInterval.is_empty (IntBestInterval.create 4 3) ;;

This expression should no longer return false. What does it return
instead?

    IntBestInterval.is_empty (IntBestInterval.Interval (4, 3)) ;;
